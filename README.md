# OpenNerve-Standard-Leads
Leads for OpenNerve that can be manufactured under GMP using standard manufacturing processes

# About
This repository holds the design files, testing protocols, and benchtop testing results for a library of "standard" leads meant to interface with the OpenNerve IPG. Leads can be manufactured by Med-Ally LLC under GMP / design controls.

## VNS cuff electrode
This lead is designed to interface with the cervical vagus nerve or other peripheral nerves with diameters between 1 and 3.5 mm. It contains two radial platinum-iridium electrodes 1mm wide with 6mm spacing, embedded in a silicone cuff.

## SNS linear electrode
The linear electrode array is designed for sacral nerve stimulation or other peripheral stimulation. It contains four platinum-iridium electrodes 3mm wide, with a 3mm spacing, as well as anchor features for maintaining position in vivo.

## EMG needle electrode
The EMG lead contains two platinum-iridium needle electrodes. It is based on the Medtronic Model 4351 lead.

## ECG electrode
The ECG sensing lead contains two electrodes that are 10mm wide, with 80mm spacing between them. It is based on the Boston Scientific 3400 S-ICD lead.

## AMS Motion Sensing Lead
The Accelerometer-based Motion Sensing (AMS) lead contains an [MIS2DH](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/mis2dh.html) accelerometer encapsulated in silicone, which can communicate with the OpenNerve IPG via I2C.
